ndesk-options
=============

This is ndesk-options, a program option parser for .NET Core.

It is based on Jonathan Pryor's NDesk.Options library with minor modifications
that allow compilation against the .NET Standard 2.0 API.

The URL of the original project is: http://www.ndesk.org/Options

Overview:
--------

It takes advantage of C# 3.0 features such as collection initializers and
lambda delegates to provide a short, concise specification of the option 
names to parse, whether or not those options support values, and what to do 
when the option is encountered.  It's entirely callback based:

```cs
var verbose = 0;
var show_help = false;
var names = new List<string> ();

var p = new OptionSet () {
    { "v|verbose", v => { if (v != null) ++verbose; } },
    { "h|?|help",  v => { show_help = v != null; } },
    { "n|name=",   v => { names.Add (v); } },
};
```

Distribution:
------------

All .NET Standard libraries are distributed and consumed as NuGet packages.
To create a NuGet package of ndesk-options, simply use the `dotnet pack`
command.

Usage:
-----

`NDesk.Options.OptionSet` is built upon a key/value table, where the
key is a option format string and the value is a delegate that is 
invoked when the format string is matched.

Option format strings:

    Regex-like BNF Grammar: 
      name: .+
      type: [=:]
      sep: ( [^{}]+ | '{' .+ '}' )?
      aliases: ( name type sep ) ( '|' name type sep )*

Each '`|`'-delimited name is an alias for the associated action. If the
format string ends in a '`=`', it has a required value. If the format
string ends in a '`:`', it has an optional value. If neither '`=`' or '`:`'
is present, no value is supported. '`=`' or '`:`' need only be defined on one
alias, but if they are provided on more than one they must be consistent.

Each alias portion may also end with a "key/value separator", which is used
to split option values if the option accepts more than one value. If not
specified, it defaults to '`=`' and '`:`'. If specified, it can be any
character except '`{`' and '`}`' OR the *string* between '`{`' and '`}`'. If
no separator should be used (i.e. the separate values should be distinct
arguments), then '`{}`' should be used as the separator.

Options are extracted either from the current option by looking for the option
name followed by an '`=`' or '`:`', or is taken from the following option IFF:
 - The current option does not contain a '`=`' or a '`:`'
 - The current option requires a value (i.e. not a Option type of `:`)

The `name` used in the option format string does NOT include any leading
option indicator, such as '`-`', '`--`', or '`/`'. All three of these are
permitted/required on any named option.

Option bundling is permitted so long as:
  - '`-`' is used to start the option group
  - all of the bundled options are a single character
  - at most one of the bundled options accepts a value, and the value
    provided starts from the next character to the end of the string.

This allows specifying `-a -b -c` as `-abc`, and specifying `-D name=value`
as `-Dname=value`.

Option processing is disabled by specifying `--`. All options after `--`
are returned by `OptionSet.Parse()` unchanged and unprocessed.

Unprocessed options are returned from `OptionSet.Parse()`.

Examples:

```cs
int verbose = 0;
OptionSet p = new OptionSet ()
  .Add ("v", v => ++verbose)
  .Add ("name=|value=", v => Console.WriteLine (v));
p.Parse (new string[]{"-v", "--v", "/v", "-name=A", "/name", "B", "extra"});
```

The above would parse the argument string array, and would invoke the
lambda expression three times, setting `verbose` to 3 when complete.
It would also print out `A` and `B` to standard output.
The returned array would contain the string `extra`.

C# 3.0 collection initializers are supported and encouraged:

```cs
var p = new OptionSet () {
  { "h|?|help", v => ShowHelp () },
};
```

`System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter` is also supported, allowing the use of
custom data types in the callback type; `TypeConverter.ConvertFromString()`
is used to convert the value option to an instance of the specified
type:

```cs
var p = new OptionSet () {
  { "foo=", (Foo f) => Console.WriteLine (f.ToString ()) },
};
```

Random other tidbits:

 - Boolean options (those w/o '`=`' or '`:`' in the option format string)
   are explicitly enabled if they are followed with '`+`', and explicitly
   disabled if they are followed with '`-`':
   
   ```cs
   string a = null;
   var p = new OptionSet () {
     { "a", s => a = s },
   };
   p.Parse (new string[]{"-a"});   // sets v != null
   p.Parse (new string[]{"-a+"});  // sets v != null
   p.Parse (new string[]{"-a-"});  // sets v == null
   ```
